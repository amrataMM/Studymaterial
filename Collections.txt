Collection Q&A


1. How do you add elements to a collection in Java?
Answer: You can use the add() method to add elements to a collection in Java. For example, to add an element to an ArrayList:


ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
list.add("element");


2. How do you remove elements from a collection in Java?
Answer: You can use the remove() method to remove elements from a collection in Java. For example, to remove an element from an ArrayList:


ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
list.add("element");
list.remove("element");


3. What is the difference between HashSet and TreeSet in Java?
Answer: HashSet and TreeSet are both implementations of the Set interface in Java. The main difference between them is that HashSet is unordered and allows null values, while TreeSet is ordered and does not allow null values.

4. What is the difference between HashMap and TreeMap in Java?
Answer: HashMap and TreeMap are both implementations of the Map interface in Java. The main difference between them is that HashMap is unordered and allows null keys and values, while TreeMap is ordered by the keys and does not allow null keys but allows null values.

5. How do you check if a collection contains a specific element in Java?
Answer: You can use the contains() method to check if a collection contains a specific element in Java. For example, to check if an ArrayList contains an element:


ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
list.add("element");
boolean containsElement = list.contains("element");


6. What is the purpose of the Collection interface in Java?
Answer: The Collection interface in Java is a framework that provides a set of standard methods for working with collections of objects. It is used as a base interface for other collection interfaces like List, Set, and Queue.

7. How do you convert an array to a collection in Java?
Answer: You can use the Arrays.asList() method to convert an array to a collection in Java. For example, to convert an array of integers to a List:


int[] array = {1, 2, 3};
List<Integer> list = Arrays.asList(array);


8. What is the purpose of the Map interface in Java?
Answer: The Map interface in Java is a framework that provides a set of standard methods for working with key-value pairs. It is used to store and retrieve values based on a unique key.

9. How do you iterate over a map in Java?
Answer: You can use the entrySet() method and a for-each loop to iterate over a map in Java. For example, to iterate over a HashMap:


HashMap<String, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
map.put("key", 1);
for (Map.Entry<String, Integer> entry : map.entrySet()) {
    String key = entry.getKey();
    Integer value = entry.getValue();
    // do something with key and value
}


10. How do you remove all elements from a collection in Java?
Answer: You can use the clear() method to remove all elements from a collection in Java. For example, to remove all elements from an ArrayList:


ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
list.add("element");
list.clear();
